# Herbarium Comp Predict herbarium types based on images 
In this competition, I have to classify 800k images into 15501 classes Images are herbariums. 
I have done experiments with part of this data and found the most effective transformers, net architecture.
The whole dataset is too big for my computational power. So I don't show the final result.
